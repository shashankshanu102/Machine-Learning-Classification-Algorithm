# Employees Retention
**PROBLEM STATEMENT:** Analysis of ‘People Charm’ dataset using classification Algorithm, People Charm  a growing company is facing a high attrition rate among their employees which in turn affects their business due to lack of expertise and experience. Their HR department is assigned the task to reduce the attrition rate by retaining employees who are about to churn out. They need to recommend special plans or strategies which will help them to retain their employees which in turn will help them to grow bigger as a company.

**DATA DESCRIPTION:**
- There are mainly two datasets :
  - Training dataset: It's consists of 14999 observations × 10 variables/features
  - Testing dataset: It's consists of 5467 observations × 9 variables/features
  
**MODEL BUILDING:** 
- Build diffrent Classication models such as :
    - 1) Logistic Regression
    - 2) k-nearest neighbors 
    - 3) Decision Tree
    - 4) Rnadom Forest, etc
    
    
**Conclusion**:
- As per the different trails I performed "Random Forest Classifer" gives the best result of 99.2 %. in the the classification Algorithm's.So for this dataset we will select 'Random Forest Classifer Model".

- Random forest algorithm is a supervised classification algorithm. As the name suggest, this algorithm creates the forest with a number of trees.
- Random forest classifier creates a set of decision trees from randomly selected subset of training set. It then aggregates the votes from different decision trees to decide the final class of the test object.
- In general, the more trees in the forest the more robust the forest looks like. In the same way in the random forest classifier, the higher the number of trees in the forest gives the high accuracy results.
- Random Forest Classifier being ensembled algorithm tends to give more accurate result. This is because it works on principle, "Number of weak estimators when combined forms strong estimator".
